# HangTimer Sound Files

Place your custom sound files in this directory to replace the default generated sounds.

## Expected Sound Files:

- **`interval.mp3`** - Played every 10 seconds during hang phase
- **`warning.mp3`** - Played at 5 seconds remaining in hang phase  
- **`phase-change.mp3`** - Played when switching between hang and rest phases
- **`completion.mp3`** - Played when the entire workout session is complete

## Sound File Requirements:

- **Format**: MP3, WAV, or OGG (MP3 recommended for compatibility)
- **Duration**: Keep sounds short (0.5-2 seconds for best experience)
- **Volume**: Record at moderate volume - the app has volume control
- **Quality**: 44.1kHz sample rate recommended

## How It Works:

1. The app will automatically try to load these files when needed
2. If a file is missing or fails to load, it falls back to generated gong sounds
3. Sound files are cached after first load for better performance
4. All files are optional - you can provide just some of them

## Tips for Good Workout Sounds:

- **Interval cue**: Clear, pleasant, not too attention-grabbing
- **Warning cue**: More noticeable, slightly urgent tone
- **Phase change**: Distinctive sound to mark transitions
- **Completion**: Celebratory, satisfying ending sound

The app is designed to play these sounds over your music/podcasts without interrupting them.
