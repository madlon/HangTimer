# HangTimer - Implementation Roadmap

*Generated: 2025-06-26*

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Timer (Estimated: 1-2 weeks)
**Goal:** Basic functional timer with essential features
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] React + TypeScript project setup with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Basic session parameter input (hang time, rest time, sets)
- [ ] Core timer logic with RequestAnimationFrame
- [ ] Screen wake-lock implementation and testing
- [ ] Basic countdown display with large, readable numbers

**Key Features:**
- Session setup with default values (30s hang, 1min rest, 5 sets)
- Large countdown timer display
- Basic start/pause/stop functionality
- Screen stays awake during sessions

### Phase 2: Complete User Experience (Estimated: 1-2 weeks)
**Goal:** Full MVP with audio and session management
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Audio system with HTML5 Audio implementation
- [ ] Set progression and session state management
- [ ] Rest period countdown and phase transitions
- [ ] Settings panel for audio toggle and custom defaults
- [ ] Complete session flow from setup to completion

**Key Features:**
- Audio cues every 10 seconds + 5-second warning
- Different sounds for hang vs rest phases
- Session progress tracking (current set, sets remaining)
- Pause/resume with proper state handling
- Audio on/off toggle

### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization (Estimated: 1 week)
**Goal:** Production-ready app with enhanced UX
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Mobile-optimized responsive design
- [ ] Visual feedback and animations for phase transitions
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Performance optimization and testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Key Features:**
- Smooth visual transitions between phases
- Visual indicators for audio cues (for silent mode)
- Robust error handling
- Optimized for various screen sizes
- Accessibility improvements

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Deployment (Estimated: 1 week)
**Goal:** Deployed MVP with initial enhancements
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) setup
- [ ] Deployment to web hosting platform
- [ ] Session history/statistics (basic)
- [ ] Custom sound selection options
- [ ] User testing and feedback incorporation

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core Timer Implementation
**Days 1-2: Project Setup**
- Initialize React + TypeScript project
- Configure Tailwind CSS and basic responsive layout
- Set up development environment and testing framework

**Days 3-4: Timer Logic**
- Implement precision timer using RequestAnimationFrame
- Add screen wake-lock functionality
- Create timer display component with large numbers

**Days 5-7: Basic Session Management**
- Build session parameter input interface
- Implement start/pause/stop functionality
- Add basic session state management

### Week 2: Audio & Session Flow
**Days 1-3: Audio Implementation**
- Research and implement HTML5 Audio for non-interrupting cues
- Create audio cue system (10s intervals, 5s warning)
- Test audio mixing with various music/podcast apps

**Days 4-5: Session Progression**
- Implement set progression and tracking
- Add rest period countdown
- Create phase transition logic (hang → rest → hang)

**Days 6-7: Settings & Configuration**
- Build settings panel for audio toggle
- Add customizable default values
- Implement localStorage for settings persistence

### Week 3: Polish & Testing
**Days 1-3: UI/UX Enhancement**
- Optimize mobile interface design
- Add visual feedback and transitions
- Implement accessibility features

**Days 4-5: Testing & Optimization**
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance optimization
- Edge case handling and error states

**Days 6-7: Deployment Preparation**
- PWA configuration and testing
- Production build optimization
- Deployment to hosting platform

## Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)
**Phase 5: Advanced Features**
- Session history and progress tracking
- Multiple timer presets for different exercises
- Custom sound theme options
- Workout reminders and scheduling

**Phase 6: Native App Consideration**
- Evaluate need for iOS App Store distribution
- Consider React Native port if web limitations found
- Enhanced iOS-specific features and integrations

**Phase 7: Expansion Features**
- Apple Health integration
- Workout sharing and social features
- Advanced analytics and progress insights
- Multi-exercise timer support

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
**Audio Issues:** Early testing with common apps, fallback to visual-only mode
**Screen Wake-lock:** Test across browsers, provide manual instructions if needed
**Timer Accuracy:** Implement drift correction and background handling
**Mobile Performance:** Regular testing on actual devices, performance monitoring

## Success Milestones
- **Week 1 Complete:** Basic timer working with screen wake-lock
- **Week 2 Complete:** Full session flow with audio cues functional
- **Week 3 Complete:** Polished MVP ready for personal use
- **Week 4 Complete:** Deployed and refined based on real-world usage
